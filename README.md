# 🎮 Steer BeamNG (Experimental)

**Steer BeamNG** is an **experimental hobby project** built to simulate a **steering wheel for BeamNG.drive** using an **Android phone** — no physical wheel required.

This project was created purely for **fun and learning**, to experience what driving in BeamNG feels like with steering-style controls without owning dedicated hardware.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Steer BeamNG works as a **two-part system**:

### 1️⃣ Windows Helper App

* Runs on **Windows**
* Built using the **vJoy public library**
* Creates a **virtual steering wheel device**
* Receives input from the Android app
* BeamNG detects it as a real steering wheel

### 2️⃣ Android Controller App

* Acts as the **steering controller**
* Provides:

  * Steering wheel
  * Pedals
  * Gearbox
  * Camera controls
* Sends real-time input to the Windows helper over network

Together, this makes BeamNG believe a real steering wheel is connected.

## 📦 Supported Platforms

* ✅ **Android** (Controller App)
* ✅ **Windows** (Helper App)
